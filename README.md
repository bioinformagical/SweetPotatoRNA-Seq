# SweetPotatoRNA-Seq
A small collection of scripts for various stages of Sweet potato RNA-Seq analysis

These are scripts I reandomly found out in the web sphere and used them for my purposes.
I no longer know where I found them and google wasn't able to find them in my exhaustive 10 second search.

If they are yours and you wish them removed, let me know. Or better still, Let me give you your due credit in the docs accordingly.
